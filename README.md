# Moshi
A Javascript-less Front-end framework tailored for mobile and dashboards.

## What ?
Moshi is a fork of [enyojs/mochi](https://github.com/enyojs/mochi/) to serve one simple purpose; impress the folks [@Pelagicore](http://www.pelagicore.com).

### Say Wut ?
It is simple, I would like to work for [@Pelagicore](http://www.pelagicore.com) as a UX Developer for that I have recently found a passion for improving sluggish car UI.

Moshi is CSS (ONLY!) Framework for designing awesome User Interfaces for Dashboards, it will be geared towards being used for QT.

## Why ?
I mainly use [Zurb's Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com) to develop any app imaginable (unless I am working on a native mobile app), but the time it takes to personalize and customize per project is steep (Really, I don't like leaving anything to its default value).
I have stumbled upon [Mochi](https://github.com/enyojs/mochi/) on my travels to find a more convenient framework to design beautiful interfaces for specific purposes (Currently Mobile, Cars, and Dashboards (You know, like Wordpress Admin Panel)).
